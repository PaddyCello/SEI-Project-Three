# Overview and Concept of the Project

When discussing our ideas for the project, we discovered that two members of the team had been to Iceland several times on holiday, and had been on many tours and road trips exploring the country. They both believed strongly that Iceland is the most wonderful and photogenic travel destination in the world, and after seeing a few photos, the other two of us were in firm agreement! So we decided to make an app that would help users to plan road trips around Iceland, offering pre-made packages, functionality for saving destinations (and thus constructing custom packages), information on beauty spots and amenities, and interactive maps. Most importantly, incredible photos of Iceland would take centre stage - we knew that anything CSS can do to make a website attractive can be done better by Icelandâ€™s breathtaking natural beauty.
